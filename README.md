# Auto Usage

A python tool for auto-generating or auto-updating usage of python cli tools.

> Note: This project was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) and the [`zhangxianbing/cookiecutter-pypackage`](https://github.com/zhangxianbing/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.

## Installation

```bash
 # install
pip install auto-usage

# usage
 cd /path/to/project
 auto-usage
```

## How to use

Auto-usage works for python cli tools based on [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), [click](https://github.com/pallets/click) or other scripts that support '--help' option for showing help message like the following [usage](#Usage).

For auto-usage using regex pattern `^[uU]sage: ` to search where the usage beginning, and using `^[cC]ommands:\s*$` to search where the subcommands beginning, you must make sure your tool's usage following the pattern.
