## How to use

Auto-usage works for python cli tools based on [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or other scripts that support '--help' option for showing help message like the following [usage](#Usage).

For auto-usage using pattern `usage: ` to search where the usage beginning, and using the `\ <command>` to search where the subcommands beginning, you must make sure your tool's usage following the pattern.
